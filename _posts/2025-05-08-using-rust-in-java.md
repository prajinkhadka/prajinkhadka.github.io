# Using Rust in Java

Java is fast, and for most use cases, the performance is more than enough â€” 
especially considering how mature the JVM is, the ecosystem around it, and how well it integrates into enterprise systems.
But every now and then, especially when dealing with **massive datasets**, 
the "fast enough" of the JVM is not enough â€” particularly in real-time data analytics systems.

Imagine building a high-throughput, real-time application that needs to parse **huge JSON payloads every second**.
[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is the go-to library in Java, 
and even [Apache Spark uses Jackson for parsing JSON](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/json/JacksonParser.scala).
However, Jackson starts to feel sluggish when dealing with large JSON files.

Obviously, we can optimize the Java code, tweak the JVM flags, 
increase heap memory, etc., but we may still not be able to break the performance ceiling.

On the other side of the spectrum, there's **Rust** â€” 
a systems language that is fast and offers fine-grained control.

What if we could **bring Rust's speed** into our JVM application without rewriting everything?

Let's run a simple benchmarking application to parse JSON using Jackson in Java and 
compare it with simd-json in Rust to see if Rust performs better or worse.

## ðŸŸ¡ Java Benchmark (Jackson)

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class JacksonBenchmark {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        byte[] jsonData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("twitter_large.json"));
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        JsonNode rootNode = mapper.readTree(jsonData);
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();

        System.out.println("Jackson parse time: " + (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000 + " ms");
        System.out.println("Parsed JSON root node: " + rootNode.getNodeType());
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”µ Rust Benchmark (simd-json)

```rust
use simd_json::OwnedValue;
use std::fs;
use std::time::Instant;

fn main() {
    let data = fs::read("/Users/prajin/Downloads/blogs/codee/twitter_large.json").expect("Failed to load JSON");
    let mut json_data = data.clone();
    let start = Instant::now();
    let _parsed: OwnedValue = simd_json::to_owned_value(&mut json_data).expect("Failed to parse");
    let duration = start.elapsed();

    println!("Simd JSON parse time {:?}", duration);
}
```

## âš¡ Results:

```
simd-json parse time: 898.583 Âµs

Jackson parse time: 123 ms
```

simd-json is ~137x faster than Jackson in this benchmark.

*This blog is not about benchmarking, so there might be other ways to improve Java's performance. 
I'm also using an older version of Java (Java 8), with no JVM tweaks or code optimization.*

This performance boost isn't magic.
simd-json in Rust leverages SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and zero-copy parsing at 
a lower level than what Java libraries like Jackson can achieve â€” primarily because of JVM limitations like garbage collection, 
memory instruction abstraction, and lack of direct SIMD usage.


**Can we bring Rust's performance to our Java application without rewriting everything?**

I faced a similar challenge in a JVM-based project.
By using JNI (Java Native Interface), I integrated a Rust-based parser directly into the Java system with minimal overhead.

In this blog, I'll walk you through how to tap into Rust's power using JNI â€” with a focus on comparing JSON 
parsing performance using Jackson vs. simd-json. Json parsing may not be the best use case of these kind of optimizations 
this specific example(Json Parser) is just used to show the usage of JNI.


## World of JVM

Before jumping into JNI and Rust, 
let's quickly discss about the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) just to understand why it sometimes hits a wall.

Java runs on the JVM, which is a brilliant piece of engineering.
It provides portability, memory safety, great tooling, and the "write once, run anywhere" capability.

That's why Java is so heavily used in enterprise applications â€” and it serves that purpose well.

But the JVM is not magic. It has trade-offs.

One of them is memory management, handled via the Garbage Collector (GC).
This is convenient for programmers â€” we don't have to worry about memory leaks or manual deallocation â€” 
but it also means we do not have full control.

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) allows CPUs to do highly parallel processing on chunks of data â€” 
like vector math used in deep learning.

Rust and C++ leverage SIMD effectively. JVM? Not so much.
It abstracts away lower-level control.
That said, newer versions of Java support SIMD through the Vector API.

There are tons of great resources on these topics to explore further.

## JNI (Java Native Interface)

If you've never worked with JNI â€” don't worry, you might never need it.
But it's good to know it exists and understand what it does.

JNI is a way for Java code to call (or be called by) native applications or libraries written in languages like C, C++, or Rust.

With JNI, we can escape the JVM sandbox and run code that can use system-level features to squeeze out raw performance â€” if needed.

At a high level, JNI works like this:

1. Declare a native method in your Java class.
2. Write the implementation of that method in a native language (C, C++, Rust).
3. Use System.loadLibrary() to load the compiled native code.
4. Let the JVM pass data between Java and native code during runtime.

While powerful, this comes with responsibility.
Since it's quite low-level, we have to manage memory carefully and be explicit about what kind of data we pass across the boundary.

I'm not an expert in this topic, but feel free to explore more if this interests you.

## Example: Porting a Rust JSON Parser to Java

Let's look at how we integrate Rust with Java using JNI.

The basic structure is:

1. Java calls the native method parseJson(String path)
2. Rust reads the file, parses the JSON, and returns a result string
3. JNI serves as the bridge between them

##  Rust Code

```rust
use std::fs;
use jni::objects::{JClass, JString};
use jni::sys::jstring;
use jni::JNIEnv;
use simd_json::to_owned_value;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "system" fn Java_RustJsonParser_parseJson(
    mut env: JNIEnv,
    _class: JClass,
    jpath: JString,
) -> jstring {
    let path: String = match env.get_string(&jpath) {
        Ok(p) => p.into(),
        Err(_) => return std::ptr::null_mut(),
    };

    let data = match fs::read(&path) {
        Ok(d) => d,
        Err(_) => return null_string(&env, "error"),
    };

    let mut json_data = data.clone();
    let result = match to_owned_value(&mut json_data) {
        Ok(_) => "parsed",
        Err(_) => "error",
    };

    match env.new_string(result) {
        Ok(jstr) => jstr.into_raw(),
        Err(_) => std::ptr::null_mut(),
    }
}

fn null_string(env: &JNIEnv, msg: &str) -> jstring {
    env.new_string(msg).unwrap_or_default().into_raw()
}
```
The modules `CStr`, `CString`, and `c_char` help with string conversion between Rust and C.

The function `parse_json` is marked with:

- `#[no_mangle]` to avoid name mangling
- `extern "system"` to use the C calling convention so JNI can call it safely

### Naming Convention Note:
If the Java class is named RustJsonParser and it declares a method `native String parseJson(String json);`,
then the Rust function must be named:

`Java_RustJsonParser_parseJson`

This naming rule is how JNI binds native functions to Java methods at runtime.

## Java Class: RustJsonParser.java

This class bridges the JVM to native Rust code.
It loads the compiled shared library (.dylib, .so, or .dll) using System.load(...) and declares the native method.

```java
public class RustJsonParser {
    static {
        System.load("/absolute/path/to/librust_json_parser.dylib");
    }

    public static native String parseJson(String path);
}
```

This class does not contain any benchmarking logic â€” it only provides a thin JNI wrapper around the Rust library.

## Java Benchmark App: Main.java

This class contains the actual logic to load the JSON file and pass the file path to the Rust parser.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "../test_inputs/twitter_large.json";
        long start = System.nanoTime();

        String result = RustJsonParser.parseJson(filePath);

        long end = System.nanoTime();
        long totalTime = end - start;

        System.out.println("\nResult: " + result);
        System.out.printf("Total time: %.2f ms\n", totalTime / 1_000_000.0);
    }
}
```

##  Build Rust for JVM Compatibility

Since I'm on a Mac M1, I compiled Rust for `x86_64-apple-darwin` (important for JVM compatibility):

```bash
cd rust_json_parser
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
```

The native compiled library `librust_json_parser.dylib` can then be loaded into the Java application.

## Summary

- Jackson is great for most use cases but starts to struggle with large real-time JSON parsing workloads.
- Rust + simd-json can give massive performance improvements.
- With JNI, we can get the best of both worlds: Java ecosystem + Rust speed.
- JNI is low-level and requires caution â€” but it's a powerful tool when performance truly matters.
